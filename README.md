## 1. Scenario Description
Ottawa's Rideau Canal is transformed into the world's largest outdoor ice skating rink each year for thousands of tourists. But for it to stay skater-friendly, there has to be ongoing ice and weather monitoring. This project replicates a real-time monitoring system using virtual IoT sensors installed at three key locationsâ€”Dow's Lake, Fifth Avenue, and the NAC. They track ice thickness, surface temperature, and snowfall. The data is streamed into Azure IoT Hub, analyzed in real-time through Azure Stream Analytics, and stored in Azure Blob Storage. The goal is to support city planners with speedy, smart safety decisions.
