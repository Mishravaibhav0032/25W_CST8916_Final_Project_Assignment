## 1. Scenario Description
Ottawa's Rideau Canal is transformed into the world's largest outdoor ice skating rink each year for thousands of tourists. But for it to stay skater-friendly, there has to be ongoing ice and weather monitoring. This project replicates a real-time monitoring system using virtual IoT sensors installed at three key locationsâ€”Dow's Lake, Fifth Avenue, and the NAC. They track ice thickness, surface temperature, and snowfall. The data is streamed into Azure IoT Hub, analyzed in real-time through Azure Stream Analytics, and stored in Azure Blob Storage. The goal is to support city planners with speedy, smart safety decisions.

## 3. Implementation Details
### IoT Sensor Simulation and Script
The project simulates three IoT sensors placed at key positions along the Rideau Canal Skateway:

-> DowsLakeSensor (Dow's Lake) \n
-> FifthaveSensor (Fifth Avenue) \n 
-> NACSensor (National Arts Centre) \n 

Sample JSON script used is below :-
```
{
  "location": "Dow's Lake",
  "iceThickness": 27,
  "surfaceTemperature": -1,
  "snowAccumulation": 8,
  "externalTemperature": -4,
  "timestamp": "2025-04-09T22:32:19.612150Z"
}
```
